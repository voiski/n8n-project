# Workflows samples

At now, all the workflows will need to be imported manually. Please, name the workflows to match the file names.

Please check for templates over the internet:
* https://n8n.io/workflows/
* https://github.com/enescingoz/awesome-n8n-templates

### Sample

* File to import: `workflows/sample.json`
* Ref link: https://n8n.io/workflows/2729-private-and-local-ollama-self-hosted-ai-assistant/

This is just a sample, please refer to its own blocks description for more information.
You can duplicate it to create your own workflow.

### Project-1

* Files to import:
    * `workflows/project-1.json`
    * `workflows/project-1-file-upload.json`
* Ref link: https://sites.google.com/i2a2.academy/agentes-autonomos-com-ia-gen/atividade-obrigat%C3%B3ria-2025-06-18

Workflow build as part of the I2A2 Automated Agent course project 1.
* First part should be able to accept a file upload (e.g. [202401_NFs.zip]) and process it, persisting its csv content into the database.
* Second part has a web interface to interact with the processed data, allowing the user to ask questions about the data, enhanced by an LLM.
